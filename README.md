# Teresa Vial Makers Lab
Lesson plans, instructions, digital materials and lesson plans for a Maker's Lab sessions, children 9-16

## Overview and Goals

I'm creating a Maker's Lab course for children 9-16 years of age at Teresa Vial School in Algarobbo, Chile.
The idea is to introduce the children to different skills they would need to build things for themselves and 
become members of the Maker community.

The lessons are two hours long each (with some 5-10 minutes of setup and tear down time) once a week for 27 weeks (TODO: verify). 
The general idea is to provide guidance and materials to children who are curious about building things. The
children will lean theory by doing, there will be no stand-alone boring lectures on theory. 
The lab will be very hands on, and project oriented in that every lesson the children will make progress on a project
related to the material we are studying. In some sessions, we may finish the project in the same session, in others we may
have to finish the project in the next sessions. 

The projects will be open ended but I will always present some constraints and initial/general ideas so as to 
seed their creativity in coming up with what they want to make, but also keeping them in the bounds what what 
that session's topic is (e.g. if we're doing a class on woodworking, I'd guide them to make something out of wood,
but not a computer program).

Children will be encouraged to work in groups of 2-3. The groups will be formed by the children themselves, 
and they will be encouraged to change groups every few weeks. Where possible, I will encourage a mix of ages and 
talents in each group so that the children can learn from each other (ala pair programming).

The course will start out with basic materials and tools, and as the children progress, we will introduce more advanced materials and tools.

The course will be talk in both English and Spanish to help the chilren learn the technical terms in both languages 
and continue to expose the children to English spoken by a native speaker.
