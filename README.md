# Teresa Vial Makers Lab

[Version Espanol](./README.es.md)

Lesson plans, instructions, digital materials and lesson plans for a Maker's Lab sessions, children 9-16

## Overview and Goals

I'm creating a Maker's Lab course for children 9-16 years of age at Teresa Vial School in Algarrobo, Chile.
The idea is to introduce the children to different skills they would need to build things for themselves and 
become members of the Maker community.

The lessons are two hours long each (with some 5-10 minutes of setup and teardown time) once a week for 27 weeks (TODO: verify). 
The general idea is to provide guidance and materials to children who are curious about building things. The
children will lean theory by doing, there will be no stand-alone boring lectures on theory. 
The lab will be very hands-on, and project oriented in that every lesson the children will make progress on a project
related to the material we are studying. In some sessions, we may finish the project in the same session, in others we may
have to finish the project in the next sessions. 

The projects will be open-ended, but I will always present some constraints and initial/general ideas so as to 
seed their creativity in coming up with what they want to make, but also keeping them in the bounds of what 
that session's topic is (e.g. if we're doing a class on woodworking, I'd guide them to make something out of wood,
but not a computer program).

Children will be encouraged to work in groups of 2-3. The groups will be formed by the children themselves, 
and they will be encouraged to change groups every few weeks. The kids will name their groups wth whatever name they like. 
Where possible, I will encourage a mix of ages and talents in each group so that the children can learn from and assist
each other (ala pair programming).

The course will start out with basic materials and tools, and as the children progress, we will introduce more advanced materials and tools.

The course will be taught in both English and Spanish to help the children learn the technical terms in both languages 
and continue to expose the children to English spoken by a native speaker. 

## About the Guide
I'm Nathan Pahucki, I was born in New York and grew up in New Jersey in the United States. From my earliest memories 
I have always been interested in building things.
I started out with legos, building blocks and erector sets. I also enjoyed building model airplanes, rockets, and cars. My insatiable curiosity 
for how things work led me to take apart everything I could get my hands on, and with experience, even put them back together in a working state. 
This helped me learn how things are made and how to fix them when they stop working. In my early adolescence I became very
interested in electricity and electronics, and began to experiment with parts from things I had taken apart. 
My favorite weekend activity with my best friend was finding discarded business equipment (photo copiers, printers, computers, etc.)
and taking them apart to salvage parts for later use. I was the only 10-year kid around with a working laser (salvaged from a photo copier)! 
A few years later after getting a pretty good understanding of digital electronics, my interest shifted to computers and programming.
I started out with an Atari 600XL, and then an old 8088 IBM PC. I learned to program Basic and then moved to Assembler code, 
writing my first computer game when I was 11 years old.
In my later teen years, I opened a business with an enterprising partner repairing consumer electronics and computers. During the slow periods
I became fascinated with various topics and would take advantage of the tools and space I had in my repair shop
to experiment with them. Fortunately for me, my partner was also inclined to curiosity and building things 
 -- he had background in house construction and taught me how to repurpose commonly available materials to fit 
whatever we needed to make. Together we experimented and constructed [Tesla Coils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil), [Van de Graff generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_de_Graaff_generator), 
and even a working [Pressure Jet](https://minijets.org/en/pulse-jets/gluhareff-pressure-jet/)!

Some years into running my business, I started writing software to solve organizational problems with the business 
(e.g. tracking payments for pager and cell phone customers, tracking repair history and payment for devices customers brought in for repair, etc.).
Some of my clients who had businesses in the area would ask me to write software for them, and thus began my career as a software engineer.
I consulted for well known financial firms in New York City like Marsh McLennan, Oppenheimer & Co. and Chase. Some years later 
I moved to San Francisco and eventually co-founded a software startup that we eventually sold to 
[AutoDesk](https://www.autodesk.com/) (a big proponent of the Maker Movement and producer not only of the popular 
AutoCAD software but [other tools for makers](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/blog/how-makers-are-making-the-most-out-of-open-access-software/)).

I currently consult for firms looking to apply cutting edge Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to their business problems.

While my work is now firmly in the realm of the virtual, I still have a passion for building things with my hands
and take every opportunity I can to do so. My favorite projects are those that allow me to combine all my accumulated 
expertise and use software to affect the physical world.
